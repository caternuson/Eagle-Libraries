# Eagle-Libraries
Eagle library files.

To make finding the libaries easier in the Eagle Library Manager, all names
are prefixed with Ooo, after the Land of Ooo from Adventure Time. No real
meaning to that. Just wanted something short and common. But also,
Adventure Time!

Orginization borrowed from [Sparkfun's libraries](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries).
